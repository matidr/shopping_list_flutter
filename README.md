# 🛒 Shopping List App

A Flutter app for creating and managing shopping list items!  
This project focuses on **forms** in Flutter: building them, validating input, handling submission & reset, and passing data between screens.  
It’s part of my ongoing journey to strengthen my Flutter skills.

## 🔮 Features

- 📝 Add new shopping list items with a form  
- ⚠️ Show on-screen validation errors for incorrect or missing input  
- ✅ Submit form data and add items to the list  
- 🔄 Reset forms to clear input fields  
- 🔗 Pass data between screens (form → shopping list)

## 📖 What I Learnt

This app helped me practice essential Flutter form handling techniques:  

- Using `Form` and `TextFormField` widgets  
- Applying input validation with custom error messages  
- Managing form state with `GlobalKey<FormState>`  
- Submitting and resetting form fields  
- Passing data across different screens  
- Building a simple, functional UI focused on learning, not styling
